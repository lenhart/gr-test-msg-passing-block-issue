test module to reproduce problem unittesting the pure message block in order to ask on mailinglist.

problem: when running test bench (make test or ctest -V in the build folder) and custom block is connected, the test won't terminate.

steps to build: 
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make 
make test
```
